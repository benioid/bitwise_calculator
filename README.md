## Overview
Bitwise Calculator is an iOS application designed to perform bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shift operations. Built using SwiftUI, this app provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to easily input numbers and perform complex bitwise calculations.

## Features
- **AND Operation**: Perform a bitwise AND operation between two numbers.
- **OR Operation**: Perform a bitwise OR operation between two numbers.
- **XOR Operation**: Perform a bitwise XOR operation between two numbers.
